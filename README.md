# FilmQueryProject

# Description
In this project we were tasked with creating a film finder which searched through our database to find movies based on different criteria. We needed to add a few details to each movie such as categories, and the language it was in through linking different tables and saving the film as an object in our java file.

# Technologies used
Git, Atom, Eclipse, Java, mySQL, maven, database

# Lessons Learned
Through this project I gained a better understanding of how to search through a database, as well as how mapping those attributes to an object could be used to create in depth searches. The biggest challenge I had throughout this project was understanding how to JOIN classes to find information that is a database removed from the table I was working with. We saw this in the implementation of getting the actors first and last name from the actor table, using a similar IDs to connect it to actor_info table, than using similar film_ids to connect it to our film table.
